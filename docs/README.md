### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
During this project I learn abot more of the git and github. This is my first time using the git and github. For me the most diffcult part is to submit the solution because I was stuck on for the longest throughout the project and in the process of learning that i learn various feature of it that I don't even know.
to solve my problem I took help from the copilot which is very helpful for me.


### Continued development
I want to focus on how to build the project in minmium amont of time with the good technology.I want to explore more about the css variable that I didn't use in this project because I not have that much knowledge about them.I would like to explore abot the tools that help in bulding thw website more perfectly.
